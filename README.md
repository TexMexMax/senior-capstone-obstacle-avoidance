Camera_Functionality is a previous state on the primary development board for this project that functions with the VC0706 serial camera from Adafruit. Use it if you wish to start from something more fresh.

Senior_Design_202 is the current iteration of this project with as many relevant features as are ready implemented into the flow. Several need further debugging, however, to the point where several features are still non-functional, especially related to the ToF sensors and any image processing.

The ToF_Sensors section contains a filter for the ToF sensor data that has been integrated into our current flow.

ToF-Arduino-Code contains an example set of code for using just two ToF sensors on an Arduino. Considering the adapted API is based on and almost identical to the Adafruit written API, this example is extremely useful.
